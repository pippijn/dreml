Partial derivatives based extended regular expression submatcher.

This project implements an `ocamllex` replacement with submatching and support
for extended regular expressions. It currently a work in progress. All
features have been implemented except for code generation, which is required
to run a lexer specification. You may run examples on the C lexer in
`testsuite/c_lexer.mll`.
