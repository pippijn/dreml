\chapter{Submatching}

In this chapter, we define the syntax for extended regular expressions. The
semantics of a pattern match is then specified as a logical relation. After the
theoretical behaviour of pattern matching is defined, we describe how a matching
automaton can be built by computing partial derivatives of patterns and regular
expressions. The partial derivatives computation used is based on a sets of
expression sets representation.
