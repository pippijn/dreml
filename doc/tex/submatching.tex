\chapter{Submatching with sets of pattern sets}

This chapter defines the syntax for extended regular expressions, on which the
semantics of a pattern match is then specified as a logical relation.  After the
theoretical behaviour of pattern matching is defined, we describe how a matching
automaton can be built by computing partial derivatives of patterns and regular
expressions. The partial derivatives computation used is based on a sets of
expression sets representation.
