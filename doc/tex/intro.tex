\chapter{Introduction}

Regular expressions are a key component of modern software development. Many
applications are nowadays inconceivable without the efficient pattern matching
provided by regular expression engines. Ever more clever optimisations and ever
more features are implemented in engines used by Perl, Java and many other
programming languages. Most programming languages have at least one engine
written in it, or have bindings to a popular C regex engine such as PCRE.

Many of these matching engines support a superset of regular languages. In order
to implement these non-regular expressions, engines use backtracking algorithms.

When constructing the partial derivative of a regular expression, the choice
operator results in a set of possible derivatives, rather than a single
derivated term.
