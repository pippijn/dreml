\chapter{Regular expression matching engines}

This chapter is dedicated to describing and comparing various existing
implementations of regular expression matching and submatching. The criteria
used for comparison are:

\begin{itemize}
   \item Time and memory requirements for automaton construction.
   \item Matching performance, in speed and memory usage.
   \item Accepted regular expression syntax.
\end{itemize}
