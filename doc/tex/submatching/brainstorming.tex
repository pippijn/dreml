\section{Brainstorming}


$2^{n-1}$ results from \texttt{(x:a*)*} but can be reduced to
http://oeis.org/A088314, because the results are essentially one possible
partition of the input length $n$. One result sets is then just another
representation of one set of parts of a partition of $n$.

Reduction is quite expensive, needs to make sure that new results are not
already in the result set.


Partial derivatives with sets of expression sets:

\begin{verbatim}
   (x:ab)(y:ac) \ a ->
     (x:b)(y:ac){x+=a}

   (x:ab)|(y:ac) \ a ->
     (x:b){x+=a}
     (y:c){y+=a}
\end{verbatim}
